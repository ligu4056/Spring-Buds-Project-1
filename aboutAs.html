                     Spring Buds Project  is committed to improving the situation of  education of girls from poor families. “ Worldwide, 132 million girls are out of school” (unicef, 2020), the inequality in social and economic growth caused by gender differences between men and women is very obvious in poor areas. Gender weakness is highlighted by the increased poverty of life. Most poor families are more willing to invest boys education. (unicef, 2020).  Many poorest girls living in rural areas spent less than three years in school. girls who receive an education have better employment opportunities and their earning potential rises by almost 12% for every additional year of schooling. Shortage of funds is an important issue when finding the reasons why girls do not go to school. In many countries especially in poor areas, girls’ education is often not taken seriously,  so Spring Buds Project foucs on donations and use them to support poor girls’ education, help them go to school.
